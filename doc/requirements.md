# Requirements
## Go

LXD requires Go 1.9 or higher.
Both the golang and gccgo compilers are supported.

The minimum supported kernel version is 3.13.

LXD requires a kernel with support for:

 * Namespaces (pid, net, uts, ipc and mount)
 * Seccomp

The following optional features also require extra kernel options:

 * Namespaces (user and cgroup)
 * AppArmor (including Ubuntu patch for mount mediation)
 * Control Groups (blkio, cpuset, devices, memory, pids and net\_prio)
 * CRIU (exact details to be found with CRIU upstream)

As well as any other kernel feature required by the LXC version in use.

## LXC
