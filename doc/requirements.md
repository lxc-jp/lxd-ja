# Requirements
## Go
LXD requires Go 1.16 or higher and is only tested with the golang compiler.

We recommend having at least 2GB of RAM to allow the build to complete.

## Kernel requirements
The minimum supported kernel version is 5.4.

LXD requires a kernel with support for:

 * Namespaces (pid, net, uts, ipc and mount)
 * Seccomp

The following optional features also require extra kernel options:

 * Namespaces (user and cgroup)
 * AppArmor (including Ubuntu patch for mount mediation)
 * Control Groups (blkio, cpuset, devices, memory, pids and net\_prio)
 * CRIU (exact details to be found with CRIU upstream)

As well as any other kernel feature required by the LXC version in use.

## LXC
LXD requires LXC 4.0.0 or higher with the following build options:

 * apparmor (if using LXD's apparmor support)
 * seccomp

To run recent version of various distributions, including Ubuntu, LXCFS
should also be installed.

## QEMU
For virtual machines, QEMU 4.2 or higher is preferred.
Older versions, as far back as QEMU 2.11 have been reported to work
properly, but support for those may accidentally regress in future LXD
releases.

## Additional libraries (and development headers)
LXD uses `dqlite` for its database, to build and setup it, you can
run `make deps`.

LXD itself also uses a number of (usually packaged) C libraries:

 - libacl1
 - libcap2
 - libuv1 (for `dqlite`)
 - libsqlite3 >= 3.25.0 (for `dqlite`)

Make sure you have all these libraries themselves and their development
headers (-dev packages) installed.
