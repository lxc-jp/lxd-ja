# Virtual Machines
## Introduction
Virtual machines are a new instance type supported by LXD alongside containers.

They are implemented through the use of `qemu`.

This feature is currently considered to be experimental with a lot of
functionality still yet to be implemented in order to reach feature
parity with containers.

## Configuration
See [instance configuration](instances.md) for valid configuration options.
