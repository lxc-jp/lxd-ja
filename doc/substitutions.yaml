{note_ip_addresses_CIDR: "LXD uses the [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) where network subnet information is required, for example, `192.0.2.0/24` or `2001:db8::/32`. This does not apply to cases where a single address is required, for example, local/remote addresses of tunnels, NAT addresses or specific addresses to apply to an instance."}
